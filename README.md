## FAQ 
1. why not use [Windi CSS](https://github.com/windicss/windicss) or [Tailwind css](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)? 
   - because Unocss is much more powerful than windi css[windi css is master faster than **tailwind**] but provide consistent api.
2. why not use [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components) or [unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import)
   - because ts with volar provider best type support, and you don't need them anymore, but if you still want to use them ,just free to try.

## TODO 

some of the other are existed to use for improving your efficiency when use vue. they are waiting for discovered.
